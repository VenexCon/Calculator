A repo for The Odin Projects Calculator project 
<hr> 

<p> This projects aim is to create a responsive calculator, with inputs and numerical operators, this will not be scientific, but rather a simple addition, subtraction, division and multiplication operand. </p>


<p>This project has taught me an immense amount of javaScript, including array methods, function calls, ES6 syntax arrow functions, DOM manipulation, Git version control and way too manmy other things to count. </p>

<p>I am proud to say that most of this was completed under my own steam and research, with only the few times of browsing SO in order to learn about different methodologies of achiving a desired result. </p>

<p> This will no doubt show in my code as i know some of it was not the most ideal way of manipulating the DOM, or calling functions, but in the end it worked and that is what I am most produd of. </P>
